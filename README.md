# Themes and Configs

## Description
This is my collection of custom themes and config settings for web and software development. I hope that you will find the content as useful as I do.

Please feel free to copy, modify, delete and/or use whatever you like.

Everything is totally free to use.

## Specifications and Requirements
Most themes and configs in this repository are, for the most part, compatible with a wide variety of operating systems, specs and local settings.

However, cross-compatibility is currently "best-effort". Not everything will be compatible with all systems. I do my best to make sure that my content is as accessible as possible. With that said, some things will need to be modified if they do not work for you "out of the box".

If you have trouble, please open a ticket and I will do my best to assist you!

### My System
To give you a __rough idea__ of the machine that I use as my "daily driver":

System specs:
  - OS: [macOS v11.5.1 aka "Big Sur"](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/)
  - Shell: [fish](https://fishshell.com/)
  - Terminal Emulator: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)

Note: I use some configs on a Raspberry Pi 4. I simply modified the configuration slightly and removed/replaced OS-specific content.

## Future Plans
I will continue to add config files and themes that I think may prove to be useful.

### Limitations
Some themes cannot be shared as they are modified versions of [Dracula PRO](https://draculatheme.com/pro), which is a proprietary product.
